First, jointly with Ke Zhang, we proved that integrable domains close to centrally symmetric are ellipses, resolving the conjecture in this setting. Second, a member of our team resolved the conjecture for perturbations of most ellipses imposing only a mild condition of integrability near the boundary. Developed techniques give a hope to be applicable in other situations. </dd></div><div class="border-t border-gray-200 pt-4"><dt class="font-medium text-gray-900"></dt><dd class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500"> A member of our team recently studied local integrability near period two orbits. He proved that most of the time an elliptic period two orbit of an analytic axis-symmetric domain canâ€™t be analytically conjugate to its Birkhoff Normal Form. The question of analytic conjugacy is nearly a century old question appearing already in the work of H. Poincare. This work opens a possibility to study analytic conjugacy in many other situations for billiards. </dd></div><div class="border-t border-gray-200 pt-4"><dt class="font-medium text-gray-900"></dt><dd class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500"> Questions related to Laplace spectrum rigidity for geodesic flows is another branch of our interest.

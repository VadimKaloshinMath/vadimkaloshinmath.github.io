He completed his PhD at the University Roma Tre under the supervision of Prof. Luigi Chierchia. Afterwards, he did one year of Postdoc at the University Roma Tre and a six months research visit in ICTP. His research centers in finite dimensional KAM Theory (quantitative integrability of Hamiltonian systems on Cantor–like sets; explicit, geometric and “sharp” measure estimate of the family of invariant tori, etc).He is also interested in the closely related subject of Mathematical Billiards, on which he is working in Prof. Kaloshin Group. Mathematical Billiard is a dynamical model that describes a frictionless motion of a massless billiard ball in a bounded domain with piecewise smooth boundary, and subjected to elastic reflections on the boundary i.e. the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence and inverse problems: get geometric insights on the domain from some purely dynamical data."},{id:2,name:"Corentin Fierobe",Nickname:"Corentin",nickname:"corentin",image:"/Corentin.jpg",job:"Postdoctoral Researcher",country:"France",details:'Corentin entered Kaloshins Group in September 2021 as a postdoc, after completing his PhD at ÉNS de Lyon under the supervision of Prof. Alexey Glutsyuk in August of 2021. His PhD is devoted to the study of periodic orbits of billiards and the famous Ivriis conjecture. He studied a wide class of billiards introduced by S. Tabachnikov, called projective billiards, which contains billiards on manifolds of constant curvature. He also investigated complex caustics of the elliptic billiard, and more generally how complex methods can be used to understand the billiard dynamics.His work in Kaloshins Group will also be focused on topics related to billiards, such as Ivriis conjecture and spectral rigidity. These questions lead to understanding the information encoded into the length of billiard periodic orbits in recovering the geometry of underlying domains (the so-called inverse problems). These problems are motivated by a famous question of Kac from "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" (Am. Math. Month., 1966): if two domains (for the Dirichets problem of the Laplacian) are isospectral, are they isometric? It was proven to be false for general domains, but for domains with a smooth or analytic boundary it is wide open.'},{id:3,name:"Yi Pan",Nickname:"Yi",nickname:"yi",image:"/ypan.jpg",job:"Postdoctoral Researcher",country:"China",details:"Yi is a postdoc at IST Austria in Prof. Kaloshins group. She did her PhD studies at CY Cergy Paris University and Paris City University under the supervision of Prof. Raphaël Krikorian and Prof. Artur Avila. In her PhD thesis, she studied the quasi-periodic cocycles valued in symplectic groups. More precisely, she worked on hyperbolicity of renormalization operator and therefore obtained a classification theorem for such systems. In Prof. Kaloshins group, Yi is working, among others, on the construction of a special invariant curve of some area-preserving map. She wants to extend her work on renormalization from quasi-periodic cocycles to area-preserving maps."},{id:4,name:"Klaudiusz Czudek",Nickname:"Klaudiusz",nickname:"klaudiusz",image:"/klaudiusz.jpeg",job:"Postdoctoral Researcher",country:"Poland",details:"Klaudiusz Czudek is a postdoc in Prof. Kaloshin group. He completed his PhD in 2021 in the Institute of Mathematics Polish Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Tomasz Szarek. His thesis was devoted to the ergodic and stochastic properties of random systems of interval homeomorphisms. Afterwards he spent a year as a postdoc in Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń in the group of Mariusz Lemańczyk and then received a Marie-Skłodowska fellowship in IST-BRIDGE program. Czudeks current research focuses on random dynamics on low dimensional manifolds and topics around. In the group he works mainly on random perturbation of Hamiltionian systems."},{id:5,name:"Illya Koval",Nickname:"Illya",nickname:"illya",image:"/Illya.jpeg",job:"Ph.D Student",country:"Ukraine",details:"Illya is a PhD student in Prof Kaloshin’s group. Currently, he is completing his Bachelor’s degree in mathematics at V.N. Karazin Kharkiv University in Kharkiv. As a high school student, he has won gold and silver medals in international competitions, including the International Mathematics Olympiad in 2019 and the International Informatics Olympiad in 2018. Illya plans to do research on various topics about billiards, such as the questions of caustic rigidity of the ellipses. This problem is known as the Birkhoff conjecture and is essentially an open question. In order to study it, he uses billiard dynamics near the domain boundary. Additionally, he is interested in the connection between the Laplace spectrum of the domain and the length spectrum of the domain arising from billiards. For this purpose, he works with various branches of analysis and spectral theory."},{id:6,name:"Yunzhe Li",Nickname:"Yunzhe",nickname:"yunzhe",image:"/yli.jpg",job:"Ph.D student",country:"Singapore",details:"Yunzhe is a PhD student in Prof Kaloshin’s group. He received his Bachelor and Master degrees in mathematics from the National University of Singapore, and the diplôme d’ingénieur from Ecole Polytechnique. Under the supervision of Prof. Dinh Tien-Cuong, he completed his master thesis on the theory of currents and its application to homogeneous dynamics. Yunzhe is interested in various problems in dynamics including mathematical billiards, spectral rigidity and quantum unique ergodicity. In Prof. Kaloshin’s group, he will carry out research on the spectral rigidity and the length spectral rigidity of billiard domains. In particular, he will analyse the prefactors of the singularities of the wave trace using tools from differential geometry and microlocal analysis."}])}));export{n as u};
